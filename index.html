        <h3>Get To Know <br>Your Body</h3>
        <p>When we think about self-knowledge, it's easy to focus on the psychological at the expense of the physical.
            However, getting to know your body is just as important as getting to know the intricacies of your mind. All
            too often, our bodies are treated as the enemy, or as a mere afterthought. Learning more about your body
            helps you to set realistic goals and know your own limits, as well as helping you feel more comfortable in
            your own skin.</p>
